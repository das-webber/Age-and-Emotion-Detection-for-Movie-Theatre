# Age-and-Emotion-Detection-for-Movie-Theatre
This project detects **age and emotion** of people entering a movie theatre in real time.   If a person is **under 13** or **over 60**, the system shows a **red box with "Not allowed"**.   If the age is **13â€“60**, it also predicts the **emotion** and shows a **green box with emotion label**.    All results are logged into `theatre_log.csv`.
