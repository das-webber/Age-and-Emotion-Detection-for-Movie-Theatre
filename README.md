# Age & Emotion Detection for Movie Theatre

This project detects **age and emotion** of people entering a movie theatre in real time.  
If a person is **under 13** or **over 60**, the system shows a **red box with "Not allowed"**.  
If the age is **13â€“60**, it also predicts the **emotion** and shows a **green box with emotion label**.  

All results are logged into `theatre_log.csv`.
